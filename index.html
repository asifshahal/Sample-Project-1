      <h2>Key Features of a Crypto Trading Website:-</h2> <br>
      <br>
      <h3>1. User Account & Security</h3> <br>

      <h3>2. Trading Pairs & Liquidity </h3><br>
      Crypto trading websites offer various trading pairs, such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USD, or even crypto-to-crypto pairs like ETH/BTC. Liquidity is essential for smooth transactions, and high-volume exchanges ensure minimal price slippage. <br>

      <br>
      Market Order – Buy or sell instantly at the current market price. <br>
      Limit Order – Set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell. <br>
      Stop-Loss Order – Automatically sells an asset when it drops to a certain price to minimize losses. <br>
      <br>
      <h3>5. Fees & Payment Methods</h3> <br>

      Withdrawal Fees – Costs for transferring crypto out of the platform. <br>
      Deposit Fees – Some platforms charge for fiat deposits. <br>
      Payment methods vary, including bank transfers, credit/debit cards, and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading for buying crypto with local currencies. <br>
      <br>
      <h3>6. Advanced Trading Tools & Feature</h3> <br>

      Real-time charts with indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands. <br>

      Trading Bots to execute predefined trading strategies. <br>
      <h3>7. Security & Regulations </h3><br>
